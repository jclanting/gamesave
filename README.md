<h1>GameSave</h1>
 
<h2>About</h2>

GameSave is a web application that finds a Steam game's current available deals when its Steam URL is inputted. For each deal listed, its host website's name/link, its price, and its percentage of money saved is listed. I used this project to become familar with using APIs and reading API documentation, something I hadn't done prior. Moreover, I intend to take this project further by eventually making a Discord Bot and Google Chrome extension version of it.

All the data used is sourced from the <a href="https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/" target="_blank">CheapShark API</a>. Shoutout to them for being so accessible and helpful!
