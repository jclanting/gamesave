<h2>About</h2>

GameSave is a Chrome extension that finds a Steam game's current available deals. For each deal listed, its URL, its price, and its savings percentage is listed. The purpose of this project was to become familar with using APIs and reading API documentation, something I hadn't done prior.

All data is sourced from <a href="https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/" target="_blank">CheapShark API</a>. Big thanks to them for being so accessible and helpful!

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>

  <li>While on that tab, open the GameSave extension.</li>
  <li>Save money using the deals provided.</li>
</ol>
